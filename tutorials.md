## T1: Critique & Redesign

__Goals:__
* Discover common flaws and mis-interpretations of visualizations
* Create visualization guidelines
* Design improved visualizations

__Material:__ [Charts](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-IwXtp2cGhzSne20MI32YTtMOlgiz0nztgKZmuCcZOk/edit?usp=sharing)

__Tasks:__

1. Analysis (10min)
   * _Individually_
   * Look at all the charts provided
   * list as many flaws as you can
2. Discussion (10 min)
   * _With your neighbor_, 
   * discuss the flaws you found 
   * compile a list of common flaws/pitfalls you found. 
   * Give each pitfall 
      * a name (e.g., 'Axes truncated') 
      * and an implication of how this might affect people's (mis)interpretation ('People will mis-interpret differences between values on the y-axis. People might misinterpret actual sizes. Etc.')
   * Discuss faults in class

_break_

3. Re-design (30min)
   * _with your neighbor_
   * pick 2 visualizations from the charts provided
   * for each visualization, sketch 2 possible redesigns
   * Argue with the guidelines (see above) and state where guidlines can be violated.
   
4. Guidelines (20min)
   * _with your neighbor_,
   * formulate visualization guidelines to overcome these flaws/pitfals. Use careful formulations: _"Do X; "Avoid Y"; "If X, then Y"; "Keep in mind that X"_, etc.

5. Show visulizations on wall (20min)


## T2: Challenge + Sketching

[DataVis2020_4-Sketching](slides/DataVis2020_4-Sketching.pdf)

1. Data Challenge: Draft a data challenge for the data you might think working with in assignment #2. A data challenge describes the context for your visualization project. Take a sheet and fold it twice so you get 4 areas. In each area, write notes about the following: 
   1. Data: 
      * What is my data about? 
      * Where does it come from?
      * How is it characterized? 
   2. Messages / Insigths / Facts
      * What am I looking for in the data? 
      * What is the data showing?
      * What do I want to tell to the reader?  
   3. Audience: 
      * Who is my audience? 
      * Why should they matter?
      * What do they know about topic? 
      * What do they know about visualization?
   4. Context
      * Where does the audience engage with the visualization? 
      * How do they engage?
   * Work out the challenge alone, then discuss with your neighbor(s)
   * Are there people with similar data and interest in class? 
2. Sketching intro: This is a quick intro by your tutor to quickly express an idea through sketching
   1. Time a few seconds to draw what your tutor is telling you (~4 pieces)
   2. Draw your home country (10sec)
   3. Draw population density inside (20sec)
3. Sketching data: Sketch your own data or some small data sample provided by your tutor
   * Draw 4 quick sketches (2min each)
   * Discuss with your neighbors
   * Elaborate on 1 visualization 
   * Discuss in class

## T3: Tools and data exploration

* Get into groups of 3 students (will be facilitated). Decide on a rough topic and search for data. 
* Decide which topic you want to work on (create a challenge sheet like in tutorial 2?)
* Look for data in the internet: what data do you need? 
* Explore a data set of your choice, using any of the tools discussed in class (e.g., Rawgraph, Tableau, D3)

Discuss with your neighbor or group members
* which visualizations did you use?
* which insights did you find? 
* how effective are the visualization you chose? What would need to be improved?
* How effective are the tool(s) you're using? Which features and workflows are working well? Which tools and features are hard to use? Which tools would you recommend?  


## T4: Storyboarding

The tutorial will start with a brief introduction into data comics and storyboarding. Your task is to create a storyboard and narrative around your visualzation projct. In this tutorial, you will work in groups. 

__Tutorial Slides:__
* [DataVis2020_8-Storyboarding](slides/DataVis2020_8-Storyboarding.pdf)

__Problem analysis__
* What is your take-home message? (--> "Insight")
* What do you want people to do? (--> "Action")
* Who is your audience?
* Why do they care? (--> "Curiosity")
* What does your audience know about the topic?
* What does your audience know about visualization and data analysis? 

__Narration__
* Write down the main points in a small story
This structure will help:
* Beginning
  * what is topic?   
  * What is my data? 
  * why does that matter?
* Middle
  * Which facts do you need to communicate?  
  * Which visualizations do I need? 
  * How can I explain each visualization? 
* End
  * summary of important findings
  * take-home message
  * Call to action, if requires

__Design__
* Create either:
   * a storyboard, 
   * the layout for an infographic, 
   * design + interaction for an interactive application

* walk the entire group through your findings.


## T5: Evaluation

__1. Visualization Critique (15min)__
* Bring your visualizations from Assignment 1
* Exchange your visualization and give constructive and critical feedback. Use the heuristics from the [Evaluation lecture]() as well as all the other lectures. Give ideas for improvement
* 10min critiquing + 5min discussion

__2. Checklist and evaluation of group project (30min)__
* Create a checklist of at least 10 items that can be used as a heuristic to evaluate a visualization
* Exchange that checklist with another group
* Evaluate your visualization according to the checklist that you have received
* For each item on the checklist, note down: 
  * how much you fulfill the advice / guideline / item (1-5 Likert scale)
  * what you could you do to improve
* If time permits, exchange checklists again

__3. Plan evaluation of group work (50min)__
* for your group project and assignment 2, create an evaluation plan & questionnaire to evaluate your visualization 
* Create: 
  * Write a piece of context about your work so that your study participants get the context 
  * Define tasks to ask the users (5)
  * Create a questionnaire that includes: 
    * asking for background (if appropriate)
    * asking for feedback on visualization and tasks. How you ask for feedback and what questions you ask is entirely up to you. Make sure that you have thought about: 
      * Which information do you need to improve your project? (e.g., can people understand X?)
      * What data do you need to get this information? (e.g., can people solve task Y, associated to feature X?)
      * What question to ask to get these data (e.g., ask a question Z that requires people to perform Y).
