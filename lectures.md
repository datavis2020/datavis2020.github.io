Just discovering after the lecture that on Jan 7, the BBC wrote an [article](https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-51020564) about the misleading visualization about Australian bushfires, discussing alternative visualizations. Quote: _"But it is actually artist Anthony Hearsey's visualisation of one month of data of locations where fire was detected, collected by Nasa's Fire Information for Resource Management System. [...] The scale is a little exaggerated due to the render's glow, but it is generally true to the info from the Nasa website. Also note that not all the areas are still burning, and this is a compilation," Mr Hearsey wrote on Instagram in response to criticism by viewers that the image was misleading."_


## Week 2: Foundations I: Basic Concepts
This lecture introduces the basics concepts of data visualizaion: Why are we using data visualization? Why does visualization work?. The lecture includes topics such as _perception_ and _color_ and concepts such as _exploratory data analysis_, _data-driven storytelling_, _visual variables_, _visual mappings_, _visualization pipeline_, _visualization techniques_, _visual representation_, and _visualization literacy_.

### __Foundations: Visualization design__
This lecture talks about effective and ineffective visualization designs. It shows examples of ineffective and deceptive visualizations and describes _visualization guidelines_ that help designing effective visualiztions. The corresponding tutorial will exercise over common problems with visualizations and work towards proposing solutions via _sketching_, a powerful method introduced in the tutorial.

## Week 4: Tools & Basic Charts

### Foundations: Tools for data visualizations
This lecture overviews and introduces common software applications (tools) to help with both: data analysis and the creation of visualizations. We will overview tools for programming environments such as python (e.g., Seaborn) and javascript (e.g., D3), but also tools using common user interfaces (e.g, [Rawgraph](https://rawgraphs.io), [Datawrapper](https://www.datawrapper.de)). The lecture will not teach _how_ to use these tools, but focus on a high-level overview of the many different tools and workflows exist to create data visualizations.

### __Video Lecture---Techniques: Basic Charts__
This is the first of a set of lectures on visualization techniques, i.e., charts and visual representations. This lecture gives a brief overview over basic charts often used in scientific reports and news papers. This includes histograms, barcharts, violinplots, boxplot, linecharts, and piecharts.

## Week 5. Techniques: Multidimensional data and Trees & Hierarchies

### Techniques: Multidimensional data
As multidimensional data we can describe all sorts of data sets that have a variety of attributes, for example columns in table. Generally speaken, the more columns a dataset has, the more dimensions it has. This lecture talks about visualization techniques for multivariate data such as __scatterplots__, __glyphs__, __Mekko Chart__, __Heatmaps__, __Beeswarm plots__, __Scatterplot matrices__, __Parallel Coordinates Plots__, and __Multi-dimensional scaling__.

### Video Lecture---Techniques: Geographic Data


## 7. Techniques: Temporal Data

__Mandatory Reading__
Glance at this paper. No need to read everything but try to get an idea of the space-time cube metaphor that the paper is talking about and how it's used to describe data visualization.
* Bach et al: A Descriptive Framework for Temporal Data

## 8. Advanced: Storytelling and Communication

This lecture focuses on effective presentation techniques when using visualizations in e.g., infographics or presentations. Other presentation media can include videos, posters, and [datacomics](http://datacomics.net). The lecture investigates how presenting and talking with visualizations is different than using visualizations for exploring and analyzing data. Spoiler alert: "It's the audience, stupid!".

## 9. Guest Lecture: TDB

## 10. Advanced: Evaluating visualization techniques
This lecture covers techniques to assess if a given visualization technique (existing or your own creation) is "successful". Successful is a broad term and refers to both effectiveness and efficiency in which a user or audience are supported in their analysis or understanding of the data. The lecture proposes five levels to check for success _Visibility_, _Readability_, _Understandability_, _Appropriateness_, _Truthfulness_. Evaluation methods involve a set of techniques from Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) such as _guidlines_,  _quantitative evaluation_, _qualitative visualization_, _user tracking_, _samples_, and _tasks_, and _statistical analysis_. 

## 11. Project presentations
In order to give anyone an overview of the many greats works on Assignment 1, this lecture slot asks each group to present their work for about ~3min (depending on numbers of groups). Presentations and presentation quality will not be graded and this is a rather informal event to show and share your work with your fellows. Don't hestiate to offer suggestions for improvement for the final hand-in of [Assignment 2] and how your colleagues have done a specific visualization.
