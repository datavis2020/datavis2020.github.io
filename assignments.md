# Assignments

The course requires handing in two assignments, each counting 50% towards the final mark. Failing to hand in an assignment at the due date, will lead to penalty points. 

Assignments will be marked using the Unversity's [Common Marking Scheme 1](https://www.ed.ac.uk/timetabling-examinations/exams/regulations/common-marking-scheme).

Keep any descriptions as brief as possible. Use __bullet lists wherever possible__. 

Make sure that you submit any written assignments using your __exam number only__, and that you state the number of words in your assignment. Your exam number is the number that starts with B on your student card. 

Table of contents, figure captions, table captions, and references do not count towards your total number of words. 

## Assignment 1

This assignment will be introduced and explained in week 3.

__Goals:__ 
* Understand how to critique a visualization
* ability to argue with the corresponding knowledge in visualization, and
* propose and sketch respective solutions.

__Scope:__ Individually (one submission per student, through [Learn](https://www.learn.ed.ac.uk))

__Weight towards course grade:__ 50%

__Due date:__ 15. February 2020

__Expected time investment:__ 15h

__Descripion:__ 
Analyze problems with a set of visualizations and propose improvements.Â 

1. Find __two__ different visualizations (on the internet, in newspapers, TV, etc.) like those in the tutorial. Different means, e.g., a line chart, a network, a map, etc. 
  * Explain who made the visualizations and in which context they were shown (Text book, Twitter, News, ...) 
  * make sure to inlude the exact link to the visualization.
2. For each visualization, describe __three__ faults and why they are problematic. 
   * Give the fault a name 
   * explain possible implications and misinterpretations. 
   * Describe possible improvements for each fault. 
   * Make sure to report different faults for each visualiztion, i.e., in total you should report __six__ faults. 
3. For each of the two visualization, 
   * Create __one__ visualization that solves the identified faults (i.e., _two_ visualizations in total). 
   * Make sure to avoid any of the common faults discussed in class and the tutorials.
   * Create the final visualization either digitally (e.g., using any of the tools discussed in class) or by sketching using pen and paper.
   * For each solution you propose, argue how you have fixed a fault from the original visualization.
   * Make sure the message is the same as in the original visualization.
   

__Handing in:__ 
* Submit through Learn.
* Submit a single PDF with as many pages as you like. Words: 500-700
* Include references to any external references (web, papers, slides, etc) in your submission if you need them for your argument.
* You can draw onto the original visualization to highlight faults and problems.
* For the visualizations in #3, you can use _any_ tool and medium you like: pen and paper, digital pens, illustrator, etc. 

__Marking scheme:__

| Task | Max-points |  
| --- | --- | 
| Two Visualizations found | 4 |
| Faults identified | 24 |
| Faults explained | 24 |
| Faults fixed | 24 |
| Fixes explained | 24 |
| _Extra points: Creativity of proposed visualization(s)_ | 4 |
| __Total:__ | __100__ |

Points will be removed if plagiarism among students is found. 


## Assignment 2

__Scope:__ In groups of 3 students (one submission per group, through [Learn](https://www.learn.ed.ac.uk))

__Weight towards course grade:__ 50%

__Due date:__ 4. April 2020

__Expected time investment:__ 15h

__Description:__ Students work in groups of 3 students to analyze, design, and implement a visualization prototype. This can include interactive web visualizations, data physicalizations, data comics, infographics, etc. 

__1. Challenge description:__ Describe a challenge around the data. A challenge includes: 
- Data: What is your data and where is it coming from?
- Motivation: What do you intend to see/show with the visualization?
- Audience: who is the indented audience for this visualization and how are thy characterized? 
- Context: what is th context that audience is using your visualization? 

__2. Visualization exploration:__ explore visualization designs for your data 
- explore at least __three different visualization designs__ with at least __two iteration__ for your data (e.g., one design per student in the group)
- explain what does and work, what does not work, and how you went on. 

__3. Final design:__ present a final design. This can be on of the following four formats: 
* Infographic
  * at least 3 different visualizations, 
  * around 200 words.
  * anything between A3 and A0 (poster) format (landscape or portrait) or 
* [Data comic](http://datacomics.net)
  * at least 4 A4 pages 
* Interactive visualization 
  * __Either__ a single  bespoke and creative interactive visualization, __or__ 
  * a set of interactive standart visualizations, i.e., multple-views.
